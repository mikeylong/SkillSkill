# Frontend Visual Playbook

Use this reference after the skill has already been selected and the mode is clear.

## Beautiful Defaults

- Start with composition, not components.
- Prefer a full-bleed hero or full-canvas visual anchor.
- Make the brand or product name the loudest text.
- Keep copy short enough to scan in seconds.
- Use whitespace, alignment, scale, cropping, and contrast before adding chrome.
- Limit the system: two typefaces max, one accent color by default.
- Default to cardless layouts. Use sections, columns, dividers, lists, and media blocks instead.
- Treat the first viewport as a poster, not a document.

## Landing Pages

Default sequence:

1. Hero: brand or product, promise, CTA, and one dominant visual
2. Support: one concrete feature, offer, or proof point
3. Detail: atmosphere, workflow, product depth, or story
4. Final CTA: convert, start, visit, or contact

Hero rules:

- One composition only.
- Full-bleed image or dominant visual plane.
- Canonical full-bleed rule: on branded landing pages, the hero itself must run edge-to-edge with no inherited page gutters, framed container, or shared max-width; constrain only the inner text/action column.
- Brand first, headline second, body third, CTA fourth.
- No hero cards, stat strips, logo clouds, pill soup, or floating dashboards by default.
- Keep headlines to roughly 2-3 lines on desktop and readable in one glance on mobile.
- Keep the text column narrow and anchored to a calm area of the image.
- All text over imagery must maintain strong contrast and clear tap targets.

Diagnostic checks:

- If the first viewport still works after removing the image, the image is too weak.
- If the brand disappears after hiding the nav, the hierarchy is too weak.

Viewport budget:

- If the first screen includes a sticky or fixed header, that header counts against the hero.
- The combined header and hero content should fit within the initial viewport at common desktop and mobile sizes.
- When using `100vh` or `100svh` heroes, subtract persistent UI chrome with `calc(100svh - header-height)` or overlay the header instead of stacking it in normal flow.

## App Surfaces

Default to Linear-style restraint:

- calm surface hierarchy
- strong typography and spacing
- few colors
- dense but readable information
- minimal chrome
- cards only when the card is the interaction

Organize around:

- primary workspace
- navigation
- secondary context or inspector
- one clear accent for action or state

Avoid:

- dashboard-card mosaics
- thick borders on every region
- decorative gradients behind routine product UI
- multiple competing accent colors
- ornamental icons that do not improve scanning

If a panel can become plain layout without losing meaning, remove the card treatment.

Hybrid demo rule:

- let the first section carry the mood, then transition quickly into a believable working surface
- do not let the marketing shell bury the actual product
- if the user needs proof of utility, show the product early

## Imagery

Imagery must do narrative work.

- Use at least one strong, real-looking image for brands, venues, editorial pages, and lifestyle products.
- Prefer in-situ photography over abstract gradients or fake 3D objects.
- Choose or crop images with a stable tonal area for text.
- Do not use images with embedded signage, logos, or typographic clutter fighting the UI.
- Do not generate images with built-in UI frames, splits, cards, or panels.
- If multiple moments are needed, use multiple images, not one collage.

The first viewport needs a real visual anchor. Decorative texture is not enough.

## Copy

- Write in product language, not design commentary.
- Let the headline carry the meaning.
- Supporting copy should usually be one short sentence.
- Cut repetition between sections.
- Do not include prompt language or design commentary into the UI.
- Give every section one responsibility: explain, prove, deepen, or convert.

If deleting 30 percent of the copy improves the page, keep deleting.

## Utility Copy For Product UI

- Prioritize orientation, status, and action over promise, mood, or brand voice.
- Start with the working surface itself: KPIs, charts, filters, tables, status, or task context.
- Do not introduce a hero section unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Section headings should say what the area is or what the user can do there.
- Good labels: `Selected KPIs`, `Plan status`, `Search metrics`, `Top segments`, `Last sync`.
- Avoid aspirational hero lines, metaphors, campaign-style language, and executive-summary banners on product surfaces unless specifically requested.
- Supporting text should explain scope, behavior, freshness, or decision value in one sentence.
- If a sentence could appear in a homepage hero or ad, rewrite it until it sounds like product UI.
- If a section does not help someone operate, monitor, or decide, remove it.

Litmus check:

- If an operator scans only headings, labels, and numbers, they should understand the page immediately.

## Motion

Use motion to create presence and hierarchy, not noise.

Ship at least 2-3 intentional motions for visually led work:

- one entrance sequence in the hero
- one scroll-linked, sticky, or depth effect
- one hover, reveal, or layout transition that sharpens affordance

Prefer Framer Motion when available for:

- section reveals
- shared layout transitions
- scroll-linked opacity, translate, or scale shifts
- sticky storytelling
- carousels that advance narrative, not just fill space
- menus, drawers, and modal presence effects

Motion rules:

- noticeable in a quick recording
- smooth on mobile
- fast and restrained
- consistent across the page
- removed if ornamental only

If Framer Motion is unavailable or heavy for the stack, use CSS transforms, opacity, and timing instead of dropping the motion plan entirely.

## Hard Rules

- No cards by default.
- No hero cards by default.
- No boxed or center-column hero when the brief calls for full bleed.
- No more than one dominant idea per section.
- No section should need many tiny UI devices to explain itself.
- No headline should overpower the brand on branded pages.
- No filler copy.
- No split-screen hero unless text sits on a calm, unified side.
- No more than two typefaces without a clear reason.
- No more than one accent color unless the product already has a strong system.

## Reject These Failures

- Generic SaaS card grid as the first impression
- Beautiful image with weak brand presence
- Strong headline with no clear action
- Busy imagery behind text
- Sections that repeat the same mood statement
- Carousel with no narrative purpose
- App UI made of stacked cards instead of layout

## Litmus Checks

- Is the brand or product unmistakable in the first screen?
- Is there one strong visual anchor?
- Can the page be understood by scanning headlines only?
- Does each section have one job?
- Are cards actually necessary?
- Does motion improve hierarchy or atmosphere?
- Would the design still feel premium if all decorative shadows were removed?
